{{< /history >}}

You can use fine-grained permissions to explicitly allow access to a limited set of API endpoints.
These permissions are applied to the CI/CD job tokens in a specified project.

This feature is an [experiment](../../policy/development_stages_support.md#experiment) and subject to change without notice. This feature is not ready for production use. If you want to use this feature, you should test outside of production first.

## Enable fine-grained permissions for projects

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Owner role for a group.

You must turn on fine-grained permissions at the group level. Then, each project in the group can
apply fine-grained permissions for CI/CD job tokens to grant access to individual resources.

To enable fine-grained permissions for all projects in a group:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **General pipelines**.
1. Turn on the **Enable fine-grained permissions for CI/CD job tokens** toggle.

## Available API endpoints

The following endpoints are available for CI/CD job tokens.

`None` means fine-grained permissions cannot control access to this endpoint.
