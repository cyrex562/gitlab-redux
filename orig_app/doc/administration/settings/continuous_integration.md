![A project's runner settings shows a message about instance runner guidelines.](img/continuous_integration_instance_runner_details_v17_6.png)

### Enable a project runner for multiple projects

If you have already registered a [project runner](../../ci/runners/runners_scope.md#project-runners)
you can assign that runner to other projects.

To enable a project runner for more than one project:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. From the left sidebar, select **CI/CD > Runners**.
1. Select the runner you want to edit.
1. In the upper-right corner, select **Edit** ({{< icon name="pencil" >}}).
1. Under **Restrict projects for this runner**, search for a project.
1. To the left of the project, select **Enable**.
1. Repeat this process for each additional project.

### Disable runner version management

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/114041) in GitLab 15.10.

{{< /history >}}

By default, GitLab instances periodically fetch official runner version data from GitLab.com to [determine whether the runners need upgrades](../../ci/runners/runners_scope.md#determine-which-runners-need-to-be-upgraded).

To disable your instance fetching this data:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Runners**.
1. In the **Runner version management** section, clear the **Fetch GitLab Runner release version data from GitLab.com** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

### Restrict runner registration by all users in an instance

{{< history >}}

- [Enabled on GitLab.com and GitLab Self-Managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368008) in GitLab 15.5.

{{< /history >}}

GitLab administrators can adjust who is allowed to register runners, by showing and hiding areas of the UI.
This setting does not affect the ability to create a runner from the UI or through an authenticated API call.

When the registration sections are hidden in the UI, members of the project or group must contact administrators to enable runner registration in the group or project. If you plan to prevent registration, ensure users have access to the runners they need to run jobs.

By default, all members of a project and group are able to register runners.

To restrict all users in an instance from registering runners:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Runners**.
1. In the **Runner registration** section, clear the **Members of the project can register runners** and
   **Members of the group can register runners** checkboxes to remove runner registration from the UI.
1. Select **Save changes**.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

After you disable runner registration by members of a project, the registration
token automatically rotates. The token is no longer valid and you must
use the new registration token for the project.

{{< /alert >}}

### Restrict runner registration by all members in a group

Prerequisites:

- Runner registration must be enabled for [all users in the instance](#restrict-runner-registration-by-all-users-in-an-instance).

GitLab administrators can adjust group permissions to restrict runner registration by group members.

To restrict runner registration by members in a specific group:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Overview > Groups** and find your group.
1. Select **Edit**.
1. Clear the **New group runners can be registered** checkbox if you want to disable runner registration by all members in the group. If the setting is read-only, you must enable runner registration for the [instance](#restrict-runner-registration-by-all-users-in-an-instance).
1. Select **Save changes**.

### Allow runner registration tokens

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/147559) in GitLab 16.11

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

The ability to pass a runner registration token, and support for certain configuration arguments
was deprecated in GitLab 15.6 and will be removed in GitLab 18.0. Runner authentication tokens should be used instead.
For more information, see [Migrating to the new runner registration workflow](../../ci/runners/new_creation_workflow.md).

{{< /alert >}}

In GitLab 17.0, the use of runner registration tokens to create runners will be disabled in all GitLab instances.
Users must use runner authentication tokens instead.
If you have not yet [migrated to the use of runner authentication tokens](../../ci/runners/new_creation_workflow.md),
you can allow runner registration tokens. This setting and support for runner registration tokens will be removed in GitLab 18.0.

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Runners**.
1. Select the **Allow runner registration token** checkbox.

## Artifacts

### Maximum artifacts size

You can set the maximum size of distinct [job artifacts](../cicd/job_artifacts.md) for:

- An instance
- Projects
- Groups

The default maximum size for each artifact file in a job is 100 MB.
For GitLab.com, see [Artifacts maximum size](../../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#cicd).

Job artifacts defined with `artifacts:reports` can have [different limits](../../administration/instance_limits.md#maximum-file-size-per-type-of-artifact).
In this case, the smaller value is used.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

This setting applies to individual artifacts in a job, not the final archive file.

{{< /alert >}}

To modify the maximum artifacts size:

- For an instance:

  1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
  1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
  1. Expand **Continuous Integration and Deployment**.
  1. Change the value of **Maximum artifacts size (MB)**.
  1. Select **Save changes**.

- For a group or project:

  Group settings override instance settings. Project settings override both instance and group settings.

  1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project or group.
  1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
  1. Expand **General pipelines**
  1. Change the value of **Maximum artifacts size** (in MB).
  1. Select **Save changes**.

### Default artifacts expiration

The default expiration time of the [job artifacts](../cicd/job_artifacts.md)
can be set in the **Admin** area of your GitLab instance. The syntax of duration is
described in [`artifacts:expire_in`](../../ci/yaml/_index.md#artifactsexpire_in)
and the default value is `30 days`.

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Change the value of default expiration time.
1. Select **Save changes** for the changes to take effect.

This setting is set per job and can be overridden in
[`.gitlab-ci.yml`](../../ci/yaml/_index.md#artifactsexpire_in).
To disable the expiration, set it to `0`. The default unit is in seconds.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

Any changes to this setting applies to new artifacts only. The expiration time is not
be updated for artifacts created before this setting was changed.
The administrator may need to manually search for and expire previously-created
artifacts, as described in the [troubleshooting documentation](../cicd/job_artifacts_troubleshooting.md#delete-old-builds-and-artifacts).

{{< /alert >}}

### Keep the latest artifacts for all jobs in the latest successful pipelines

When enabled (default), the artifacts of the most recent pipeline for each Git ref
([branches and tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References))
are locked against deletion and kept regardless of the expiry time.

When disabled, the latest artifacts for any **new** successful or fixed pipelines
are allowed to expire.

This setting takes precedence over the [project setting](../../ci/jobs/job_artifacts.md#keep-artifacts-from-most-recent-successful-jobs).
If disabled for the entire instance, you cannot enable this in individual projects.

To disable the setting:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Continuous Integration and Deployment**.
1. Clear the **Keep the latest artifacts for all jobs in the latest successful pipelines** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**

When you disable the feature, the latest artifacts do not immediately expire.
A new pipeline must run before the latest artifacts can expire and be deleted.

{{< alert type="note" >}}

All application settings have a [customizable cache expiry interval](../application_settings_cache.md) which can delay the settings affect.

{{< /alert >}}

### Disable the external redirect page for job artifacts

By default, GitLab Pages shows an external redirect page when a user tries to view
a job artifact served by GitLab Pages. This page warns about the potential for
malicious user-generated content, as described in
[issue 352611](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352611).

GitLab Self-Managed administrators can disable the external redirect warning page,
so you can view job artifact pages directly:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand **Continuous Integration and Deployment**.
1. Clear **Enable the external redirect page for job artifacts**.

## Archive jobs

You can archive old jobs to prevent them from being re-run individually. Archived jobs
display a lock icon ({{< icon name="lock" >}}) and **This job is archived** at the top of the job log.

To set the duration for which the jobs are considered as old and expired:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin**.
1. Select **Settings > CI/CD**.
1. Expand the **Continuous Integration and Deployment** section.
1. Set the value of **Archive jobs**.
1. Select **Save changes** for the changes to take effect.

After that time passes, the jobs are archived in the background and no longer able to be
retried. Make it empty to never expire jobs. It has to be no less than 1 day,
for example: <code>15 days</code>, <code>1 month</code>, <code>2 years</code>.

For the value set for GitLab.com, see [Scheduled job archiving](../../user/gitlab_com/_index.md#cicd).

{{< /details >}}

{{< history >}}

- [Moved](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/352316) from GitLab Premium to GitLab Ultimate in 15.0.
- [Deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/389467) in GitLab 15.9.
- [Removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/389467) in GitLab 17.0.
- [Re-added](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/165111) behind the `required_pipelines` feature flag in GitLab 17.4. Disabled by default.

{{< /history >}}

{{< alert type="warning" >}}

This feature was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/389467) in GitLab 15.9
and was removed in 17.0. From 17.4, it is available only behind the feature flag `required_pipelines`, disabled by default.
Use [compliance pipelines](../../user/compliance/compliance_pipelines.md) instead. This change is a breaking change.

{{< /alert >}}

You can set a [CI/CD template](../../ci/examples/_index.md#cicd-templates)
as a required pipeline configuration for all projects on a GitLab instance. You can
use a template from:

- The default CI/CD templates.
- A custom template stored in an [instance template repository](instance_template_repository.md).

  {{< alert type="note" >}}

  When you use a configuration defined in an instance template repository,
  nested [`include:`](../../ci/yaml/_index.md#include) keywords
  (including `include:file`, `include:local`, `include:remote`, and `include:template`)
  [do not work](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/35345).

  {{< /alert >}}

The project CI/CD configuration merges into the required pipeline configuration when
a pipeline runs. The merged configuration is the same as if the required pipeline configuration
added the project configuration with the [`include` keyword](../../ci/yaml/_index.md#include).
To view a project's full merged configuration, [View full configuration](../../ci/pipeline_editor/_index.md#view-full-configuration)
