The availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag.
For more information, see the history.
This feature is available for testing, but not ready for production use.

{{< /alert >}}

In a GitLab Query Language (GLQL) [query](_index.md#query-syntax), a field is the leftmost part
of the expression.
In queries, fields follow the syntax of `<field> <operator> <value> and ...`,

In a [GLQL view](_index.md#glql-views), fields are included as a comma-separated list of tokens in
the `fields:` option.

This page lists fields available to use as filters when querying issues or work items.

## Type

{{< history >}}

- [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-query-language/glql-rust/-/merge_requests/81) in GitLab 17.8.

{{< /history >}}

**Description**: The type of object to query: one of the work item types or merge requests.

**Field name**: `type`

**Allowed operators**: `=`, `in`

**Allowed value types**:

- `Enum` (one of `Issue`, `Incident`, `TestCase`, `Requirement`, `Task`, `Ticket`, `Objective`,
  `KeyResult`, or `MergeRequest`)
- `List` (containing one or more `enum` values above)

**Allowed in columns of a GLQL view**: Only for issue and work item types.

**Additional details**:

- If omitted when used inside a GLQL view, all issue and work item types are included by default.
- Work item types (like `Issue`, `Task`, or `Objective`) cannot be used together with `MergeRequest` types.
- The type field isn't allowed in columns of a GLQL view for `MergeRequest` types.

**Examples**:

- List issues of type `Incident`:

  ```plaintext
  type = incident
  ```

- List issues of types `Issue` or `Task`:

  ```plaintext
  type in (Issue, Task)
  ```

- List all merge requests assigned to the current user:

  ```plaintext
  type = MergeRequest and assignee = currentUser()
  ```

- Using the `group` field queries all objects in that group, all its subgroups, and child projects.
- By default, issues or merge requests are searched in all descendant projects across all subgroups.
  To query only the direct child projects of the group, set the [`includeSubgroups` field](#include-subgroups) to `false`.
