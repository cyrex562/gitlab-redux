    The Dependency Proxy for containers accepts `docker login` and `docker pull` requests using personal access tokens or group access tokens without validating their scopes.

    In GitLab 18.0, the Dependency Proxy will require both `read_registry` and `write_registry` scopes for authentication. After this change, authentication attempts using tokens without these scopes will be rejected.

    This is a breaking change. Before you upgrade, create new access tokens with the [required scopes](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/dependency_proxy/#authenticate-with-the-dependency-proxy-for-container-images), and update your workflow variables and scripts with these new tokens.
