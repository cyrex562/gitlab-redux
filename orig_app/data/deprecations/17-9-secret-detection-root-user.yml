    From GitLab 18.0, the secret detection analyzer will no longer use the root user by default. You shouldn't experience any impact as a result of this change. However, you might experience issues if you use `before_script` or `after_script` to make changes to the image. GitLab doesn't support this use of `before_script` and `after_script`.
