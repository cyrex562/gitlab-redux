    In GitLab Runner 18.0, to limit the potential for token leakage, the
    default value for the `FF_GIT_URLS_WITHOUT_TOKENS` feature flag changes
    to `true`.

    This change affects users who:

    - Use executors that share Git credential state across jobs (for example, shell executor).
    - Have a caching Git credential helper installed (for example,
      [gitforwindows](https://gitforwindows.org/) installs
      [Git credential manager (GCM)](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager)
      system-wide by default).
    - Run builds in parallel.

    To prevent issues, ensure that you don't use any caching Git credential
    helper with GitLab Runner, use an executor which runs jobs in isolated
    environments, or run job serially only.
